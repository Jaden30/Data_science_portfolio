A random csv file was generated containing :
  1. Height
  2. Weight 
  3. Eye 
  4. Species either cat or dog 

A simple machine learning model using binary classification was created using Height, Weight, Eyes as X and species as Y to predict the type of species based on the X given in the juypter notebook named model.py 

Pickling was used to create a better user experience.

Libraries used:
  1. Pandas
  2. Sckit-learn
